                Our club is sponsored by Adobe and part of our sponsorship involves promoting and planning events
                 that allow students to get to know more about Adobe's AMAZING line of software products.
                  The events team will work with me to promote about 4 events per semester, collaborate with
                  other clubs, and promote the brand's presence.

                The Design Tree team will be creating an interactive pop-up that raises awareness about design.  There will be a virtual and a
                physical element to this. The virtual element is a network graph of people where individuals can add drawings, music, etc. to
                their node and connect with others. The physical element would be a physical tree that moves around campus with design prompts
                as "leaves". An individual could then open up an app/website and answer the prompt on their node.
